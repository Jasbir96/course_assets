<!-- Comments are numbered in the form CO to Cn. -->

<!-- C0 - Overview -->
<!-- In this POC we will see how we can record the video input captured through camera and mic. To do so we have brought over the code from mediaDevices POC and will be improving on it. We have also removed audio element and its references as we will be working with video only  -->

<!-- C1 -->
<!-- Steps involved:

1- Remove audio element and its references from the script, add a button with id 'record-video', store the reference of this button in the script
2- In script create few variables mediaRecorder (this will store MediaRecorder object later explained), chunks and initialise it to empty array and recordState, which is initially set to false
3- In the then function create a MediaRecorder object, give it the mediaStream object and save that instance in the variable created in step 2
4- On mediaRecorder attach 2 event handlers, 
    a-  ondataavaiable => this will collect all the data that is coming from mediastream
    b-  onstop => this will save all the collected data in file which will be saved to our disk
5- Attach an click event handler to the button which on click will toggle the recordState and start/stop the recording  -->
