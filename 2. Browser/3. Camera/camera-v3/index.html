<!-- In this version of camera we will improve on camera v2 and add the functionality to filters -->

<!-- C1 -->
<!-- Steps involved: -->
<!-- 1- Copy all the code from camera v2.
2- Get reference of all filters in the script and attach click event handler on them. Create a global variable called 
filter and set it to empty string. Now in the event handler of filter we want 2 things (Remember filter only works on 
pictures):
    a- To store which filter is being used in global filter variable so that we can apply that on time of capturing the 
    picture.
    b- To actually show filter on UI
3- Create 2 functions:
    a- addFilterToScreen: This will add the filter on the UI 
    b- removeFilter: This will remove filter from UI
4- We will have one bug that the filter we are showing on the UI will 
hide the buttons and filter UI elements below it, so we have to give them a higher z-index
5- We will also call removeFilter whenever we will record video because filters are not valid 
for videos in our app
6-Last thing we have to do is actually apply filter to the picture that is being taken(Remember filter colors 
should have opacity less than 1 something like 0.3 or 0.4 so that original image is actually visible). 
To do this we will imporve our capture function, now it will take filter as argument-->
