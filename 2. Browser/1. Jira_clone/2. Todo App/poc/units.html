    <h1>rem,vh,vw,px,%</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>200px</p>
    <p>
      This div will always occupy 200px x 200px no matter how you change shape
      and size of browser
    </p>
    <div class="d1"></div>
    <hr />
    <p>20vh and 20vw</p>
    <p>
      The v in vw and vh stands for viewport, which is user's visible area of a
      web page. h in vh stands for height and w in vw stands for width.So when
      we say 20vw and 20vh, the div will occupy 20% of the user's visible area
      of web page. That means if you change shape and size of browser the size
      of div will also change.
    </p>
    <div class="d2"></div>
    <hr>
    <p>50% of my parent</p>
    <p>We can give sizes in terms of percentage, in that case the current element to which we are applying css rule will look to its parent and get x% of its parents size. This is also called inheritance and can also be seen in fonts.</p>
