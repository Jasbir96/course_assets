Q5 => Trick Or Treat
      // Either you can be tricked or be treated
      // trickOrTreat Method is called for you and you are getting tricked every time
      // modify the treat function in such a way that you get treat always !

// Code Starts Now =>

surprise = "You are Tricked";
let pumpkin = {
    surprise : "Congratulations here are Turkish Delights for you !!",
    trickOrTreat : function(){
        console.log("Ready to be tricked or to be treated");
       // Change below code 
        function treat(){
            console.log(this.surprise);
        }
        treat();
       // Change above code
    }
}
pumpkin.trickOrTreat();

or
use bind method to bind treat to object pumpkin
