Description:
A spoonerism is an error in speech in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched between two words in a phrase. 
For example,

    kite flying becomes fite klying

Your task is to create a function 'spoon' that takes a string of two words, separated by a space and returns a spoonerism of those words in a string, as in the above example.
Note: Input will always contain 2 words

Sample Input:
kite flying

Sample Output:
fite klying

Test Cases:

    Input#1:
    "not picking"

    Output#1:
    "pot nicking"


    Input#2:
    "horse riding"
    
    Output#2:
    "rorse hiding"

Solution:
function spoon(phrase) {
  phrase = phrase.split(" ");
  let word1Initial = phrase[0][0];
  let word2Initial = phrase[1][0];

  return (
    word2Initial + phrase[0].slice(1) + " " + word1Initial + phrase[1].slice(1)
  );
}
